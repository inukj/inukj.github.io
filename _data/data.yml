        tagline: "TimesVector is a triclustering tool for clustering time-series data that comprises multiple conditions, or phenotypes. It identifies gene clusters that exhibit distinctly similar or different gene expression patterns among the comparing sample conditions. For example, for a time-series data set of five different strains of yeast, each data sampled at 3 time points, TimesVector will search for gene clusters where a specific strain shows a distinctively different gene expression pattern from the others."
